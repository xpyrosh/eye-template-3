                        <h3>Our qualifications: What it means to be Board Certified</h3>
                        <p><br>All Ocularists currently practicing in Ontario are required to be Board Certified by the National Examining Board of Ocularists (NEBO) in order to bill ADP for services rendered. NEBO is associated with the American Society of Ocularists (ASO). The ASO is the only certifying educational body for Ocularists in the world and is known for it's very high standards in education.<br><br>
    
                        Training for an Ocularist is done on an apprentice basis which requires 10,000 hours (a minimum of 5 years) of practical work with a journeyman Ocularist as well as the class time and required course load.<br><br>
                            
                        Our education is ongoing and we are required to certify every six years by taking courses, writing exams, etc. For this we typically must travel to the USA in the spring and fall for about five days each year to attend courses and lectures.<br><br>
                            
                        We also have certification from the ASO to assert that all course requirements have been met to receive their diploma and to be able to use the credentials BADO (Board Approved Diplomate Ocularist).</p>
